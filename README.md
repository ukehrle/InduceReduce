The package "InduceReduce" provides an implementation of Unger's algorithm for computing the table of ordinary irreducile characters of a finite group. The algorithm works by inducing characters from suitably chosen elementary subgroups and finding an orthogonal basis of the resulting lattice of characters by LLL lattice reduction.


Installing and Loading the package:
===================================

InduceReduce does not use external binaries and, therefore, works without
restrictions on the type of the operating system.

There are two ways of installing a GAP package. If you have permission to add
files to the installation of GAP on your system you may install InduceReduce into
the 'pkg' subdirectory of the GAP installation tree. Otherwise you may install
InduceReduce in a private 'pkg' directory (for details see '76.1 Installing a GAP Package' and '9.2 GAP Root Directories' in the reference manual).

Once you have installed the package, you can load it in a GAP session using the following command:

    gap> LoadPackage("InduceReduce");
